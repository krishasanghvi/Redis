Hi I am Robin!

Plan for making code more readable and scalable

There is a master instance
There can be several slave instances
There could be several clients which may connect


Redis server service -> receives commands (could be from client or master) and return response
Command Identifier service ->



this is called whenever we start a redis instance
what does a redis instance have
it has a storage
capability to interact with the storage
